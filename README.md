# Chirp-Birdsong-Recognition

## Problem Statement:
Birdsong recognition is crucial for ecological monitoring and biodiversity conservation. It helps scientists and conservationists track bird populations, assess environmental health, and detect changes in ecosystems. Birdcalls can vary significantly within and between species. Factors such as environmental noise, overlapping calls, and individual variations further complicate accurate recognition.

## Approach:
The ’Chirp’ project aims to develop an efficient and accurate birdcall recognition system using machine learning techniques. We will analyze patterns in our audio data (EDA), extract unique features (FE) from it that help differentiate one birdcall from another, remove any background noise and build a neural network model that will enable the identification of bird species based on their unique vocalizations.

## Tech Stacks:
### 1.Programming Languages: 
Python
### 2. Libraries and Frameworks: 
NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Librosa, Sklearn, PyTorch/Tensorflow
### 3. Tools: 
Jupyter Notebook/Google Colab, Kaggle
